# Hotel Bookings Analysis
With the Hotel Bookings Reporting application it is possible to explore hotel booking data and provide reports on upcoming bookings.

## Documentation
There are two ways to access the documentation
1. Read the [online documentation](https://hotel-booking-documentation.herokuapp.com/)
2. After cloning the repository, open the file **home.html** in the docs folder

## Further improvements
1. Create class for analysis logic and place analysis functions in it.
2. Create object of analysis logic class in GUI and call methods.

With that the application would follow an OOP approach.
